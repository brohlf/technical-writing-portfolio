## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
You need to have the Discord app installed, and you need to have an account. If you need assistance with either of these steps, consult Discord's guide to [Getting Started](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started). That process will only take a few minutes.

System requirements can be found [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/213491697-What-are-the-OS-system-requirements-for-Discord-). (You'll need about 65 MB of available hard drive space.)

If you're configuring a server that you don't own, you'll need the *Manage Server* permission on that server. Otherwise, no experience with Discord beyond installation and account creation is necessary.

## 1. Create Your Server <a name="serverCreation"></a>
Let's create that server. This will be quick and easy!

**Note:** Don't worry about server templates for now. They won't help with what we're doing.
