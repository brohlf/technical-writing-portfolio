
### Knights and Sorcerers

Knights and Sorcerers is a fictional massively multiplayer online (MMO) roleplaying game (RPG) that I devised for this example of RESTful API documentation. For context, think of World of Warcraft or Guild Wars.

I wrote the API document using Markdown.

TODO: talk about inspirations (Stripe API doc, Blizzard API docs, medium API doc)

**Note:** The API document contains mock links to other documents. These just lead back to the API document.
